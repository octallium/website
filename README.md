## Introduction

**Octallium** is an online ninja training school ‚öîÔ∏è for the Learning Enthusiast and dedicated to the programming toddlers. Start by learning how to hold basic programming chopsticks ü•¢, then take the journey all the way to becoming a Programming Zen Master üê≤.

We don't make any assumption about your prior programming knowledge and try to teach everything from scratch.

Let the force be with you!

## Audience

The resources are intended for the beginners, toddlers, hobbyist coders, dedicated but not-learnt and new programmers. It can also be used as a reference by more experienced developers.

## Motivation

As a beginner I really struggled to find the right sources for learning Python and ended up taking a lot of free and paid online courses, which finally ended up in confusion and frustration. So I decided to write a simple to understand, beginner oriented resources for learning Python.

## Code Sample

All code will be in the form of following block

```python
# python code
def hello():
    print('Hello World')
```

## About Me

Hi, my name is Anil Kulkarni and I am passionate about coding. I am a self learned programmer and enjoy my daily dose of Python & Go. When I am not coding you can usually find me watching movies üé¨

## Post Schedule

I would be posting updates twice a week, on Tuesday & Thursday (IST). Currently, there is no deadline for creating new articles, whatever I manage to finish will be pushed online.

## Contributing Content

The entire project is open source and available on Github, including this website which is using Github Pages. You can star, fork or better send a pull request, all the updates would be reviewed and posted as per the schedule. Currently the project is using Mkdocs, but aim to move to custom web framework somewhere in the future.
