# Conditions {++ if/else++}.

<hr>

## Objective

To understand if/else conditions.

If/else conditions are of very fundamental importance to programming and are present in all the programming languages.

The intent of condition is very simple

    if condition {
        do something
    } else {
        do another thing
    }

## Structure

Navigate to our code folder

    code/basic/

For our program create a new folder '07_if_else'

    code/basic/07_if_else

And lets create a file 'if_else.go' in it, finally the structure would look like this:

    code/basic/07_if_else/if_else.go

## Code

The code will be divided into two parts

1.)

???+example "if/else condition"
`go 1 package main 2 3 import "fmt" 4 5 func main() { 6 d := "Dog" 7 c := "Cat" 8 9 // checking the value of variables 10 if d == "Dog" { 11 fmt.Println("Woff") 12 } else { 13 fmt.Println("I don't know which animal!") 14 } 15`

Review

on line 10 we check if the value of the variable "d" is equal to "Dog"

    if d == "Dog"

If the condition is true then we print out "Woff"

    fmt.Println("Woff")

If the condition is false, we print "I don't know which animal"

    fmt.Println("I don't know which animal!")

2.) If/else statements can also be chained if you have multiple conditions

???+example "if/else condition"

    ``` go
    16 // You can also chain if / else conditions
    17 if c == "monkey" {
    18	fmt.Println("I am a monkey.")
    19 } else if c == "Dog" {
    20	fmt.Println("I am a dog.")
    21 } else if c == "Cat" {
    22	fmt.Println("Meoww")
    23 }
    24 }
    ```

Review

On line 17 we check if value of the variable "c" is "monkey", if the conditions evaluates to true then we print "I am a monkey"

    if c == "monkey"

If it evaluates to false then we check it once again if it contains the value of "Dog"

    if c == "Dog"

Since, this also evaluates to false, we check for the next condition

    if c == "Cat"

As it evaluates to true, we print out "Meoww" on the screen

    fmt.Println("Meoww")

In case if "c" does not evaluate to true in any of the case, {++ nothing++} will be printed.

## Running your code

Open your terminal and navigate to our folder

    ccode/basic/07_if_else

Once in the folder type the following command

    go run if_else.go

## Output

???+ success "Output"

        Woff
        Meoww

## Note

Strings in Go are case sensitive, "monkey" and "Monkey" are evaluated differently, so be sure of using the right case when checking for evaluation.

## Github

Just in case you have some errors with your code, you can check out the code at github repo

## Golang Playground

You can also run the code at playground

## Next

We will see {++ for++} loops.
