# About

Hi, my name is {==Anil Kulkarni==} and I am passionate about coding. I am a self learned programmer and enjoy my daily dose of coding. When I am not coding you can usually find me watching movies ðŸŽ¬

## Post Schedule

I would be posting updates twice a week, on Tuesday & Thursday (IST). Currently, there is no deadline for creating new articles, whatever I manage to finish will be pushed online.

## Motivation

As a beginner I really struggled to find the right sources for learning and ended up taking a lot of free and paid online courses, which finally ended up in confusion and frustration. So I decided to write a simple to understand, beginner oriented resources for learning how to program.
