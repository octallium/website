The entire project is open source and available on Github, including this website which is using Github Pages. You can star, fork or even better send a pull request, all of the updates would be reviewed and merged as per the schedule.

Currently the project is using Mkdocs to generate content, but aims to use Phoenix Framework sometime in the future.
