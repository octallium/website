# Setting Up Your Development Environment For Go.

<hr>

There are many choices available, both free and paid, I haven't tried all of them, but I would like to suggest a couple of them that work well for golang development.

## Editors

- Sublime Text
- Atom
- Visual Studio Code
- Vim

## IDE

- Goland By Jetbrains (Paid)
- Eclipse

This list is by no means exhaustive, there are much more available, if you want a complete list check out the community maintained list [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/IDEsAndTextEditorPlugins)

I personally use {++ Visual Studio Code++}, there's nothing wrong with other editors, just that I am used to working with VS Code and pretty comfortable using all the keys.

## Installing 'Go' Plugins

Just downloading and installing the editor or IDE is not sufficient, make sure you install the respective 'Go' plugins to get started with development.

Plugins

1. VS Code - [Go - By Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.Go)
2. Atom - [Go Plus](https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus)
