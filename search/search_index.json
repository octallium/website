In addition to this the concurrency model is what makes it more interesting and perhaps easy to use.</p> <p>In a real world, concurrency is hard! Mutability makes it hard, but <code>Go</code> takes a different approach and shares memory by communicating. Many other programming languages suffer because concurrency was an after thought and provide somewhat awkward concurrency models or are mostly single threaded. But concurrency was built into <code>Go</code> and it provides primitives such as <code>goroutines</code> and <code>channels</code> for handling concurrency.</p> <p>In the battle for concurrency and multi-threaded applications, <code>Go</code> certainly ranks very high, but certainly it isn't the only one. Other programming languages such as <code>Elixir</code> provide far better concurrency model with its <code>Actor Model</code> and are a pure pleasure to work.</p> <p><code>Go</code> finds wide application from <code>System Programming</code> to <code>Web Applications</code> and lot of developers use it their everyday jobs.
