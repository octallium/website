I am a self learned programmer and enjoy my daily dose of coding. When I am not coding you can usually find me watching movies \ud83c\udfac Post Schedule I would be posting updates twice a week, on Tuesday Thursday (IST). Currently, there is no deadline for creating new articles, whatever I manage to finish will be pushed online.
