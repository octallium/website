But, before actually installing there are some points that I would like you to note.

Python 2 will officially be retiring on Jan 1 st , 2020, so its ideal to straight away get working with Python 3. Check out the installation instructions as per your operating system. Installing on Windows Installing Python 3 on Windows is just as easy as installing any other program, in addition to Python 3, I would highly recommend installing Git Bash , so that you can work with the exact same commands in the tutorial as mine and we need not keeping on switching between operating systems. Ofcouse, I will let you know whenever there are differences. Navigate to following link and download the setup file 1 https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ Under Stable Releases check out your system and download the setup file accordingly, in most cases your system should be 64 bit, if that's the case you can download the following setup file 1 Windows x86-64 executable installer After downloading you can install it as you would install any other program. The installer will install everything and also setup environment variables. Installing on Mac Navigate to following link and download the setup file 1 https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/ Under Stable Releases you can download the following file 1 macOS 64-bit installer And then install it as any other program, it will automatically setup environment variables for you.

Isn't it supposed to be a reptile! Well, it also happens to be a really great programming language. If you are just starting your programming journey, Python is the right place to start, it offers nice and clean syntax, vast library, online available content, huge community, etc. Today's software industry has a huge collection of programming languages like C, C++, Java, Javascript, Go, Rust, etc. Each of the language has its own pros and cons, there is no 'One Size Fits All' concept and one has to really consider the project requirements in order to select a language. So, that brings us to the next question, WHY Choose PYTHON ? Why Python? \ud83d\udc0d Simple answer is, because its Amazing! Surely python also has its share of pros and cons, but offers a lot more in return, such as follows - Are you a beginner ? Python is the perfect place to start, it will help you to understand a lot of the basic programming concepts and then you can move on to other languages if required. Python really helps you to be productive, you can achieve a lot more in few lines of code. In addition to it, Python is very robust, performant and provides high scalability. Python offers a simple and clean syntax, no semicolons! Python has a vast library support, you can find a library for almost any functionality you can think off! Web development no problem! Python has robust web frameworks like Django, Flask, Pyramid, etc. Creating command line applications, again no problem! Python is great fit for Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Business Analytics, etc. Need to work with files such as csv, xls, pdf, zip, etc, ...aah just a piece of cake. Python is great for rapid development, you can easily bootstrap a project with the vast eco-system that python provides. Sounds exciting! Let's dive more into it. What is Python? As you already know that python is a programming language, for now just remmember its an interpreted language, i.e the python interpreter acts like an interface between you and the machine. You write in English and python converts it into a language that the machine can understand, simple isn't it? Who's using Python? Almost everyone uses python, from big companies like Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Microsoft, etc to research institutes like CERN, NASA, etc, everyone uses python! What will I learn here?

In order to understand variables, I'd like you to meet Billy , he is a friendly dinosaur and is currently planning for his birthday party. Billy is very excited about the party and is busy thinking about packaging all the return gifts. Billy has three type of return gifts - Balloons Party Hats Crackers Declaring Variables Let's start by creating a file called as 'variables.py' anywhere on your computer and open it in your code editor and type the following - 1 2 box = Baloons print ( box ) In order to run the file, open the terminal and navigate to the directory which contains the file. Suppose I have created that file on my desktop, then the path on my terminal will be - 1 $ cd /Users/ { your username } /Desktop In order to run the file, type the following in your terminal - 1 $ python3 variables.py Output will be as follows - 1 Baloons Congratulation! You just created a variable and printed its value. Understanding Variables Let us again have a look at the code we wrote above 1 2 box = Baloons print ( box ) You are declaring a variable called box and assigning it a value of Baloons , note the single quote around it, you can also use double quotes as follows and it will give you the same output. 1 2 box = Baloons print ( box ) Single and double quotes can be used interchangeably, but be sure to use a consistent style all across your code. Printing Values 1 2 box = Baloons print ( box ) Line 2 prints the value of the variable 'box' to the terminal, which in our case is 'Baloons'. 1 Baloons print() is a builtin python function which we can easily use to print values. Re-assigning Values Suppose, now Billy wants to pack 'Party Hats' instead of 'Baloons', then we can re-assign a new value to the same variable 'box' 1 2 box = Party Hats print ( box ) You can again check the value by running the file 1 python3 variables.py Output 1 Party Hats Notice that our value has now changed from 'Baloons' to 'Party Hats'. And now finally Billy wants to pack 'Crackers', so we can once again re-assign 'box' to a new value of 'Crackers' 1 2 box = Crackers print ( box ) If you run the file again, this time output will be 1 Crackers Full Code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # variables.py box = Baloons print ( box ) # prints - Baloons box = Party Hats print ( box ) # prints - Party Hats box = Crackers print ( box ) # prints - Crackers Conclusion As you must have noticed box is just a placeholder, we can assign different values to it from time to time, thus it is know as a variable, i.e values can change but the placeholder remains the same.

Suppose I have created that file on my desktop, then the path on my terminal will be - 1 $ cd /Users/ { your username } /Desktop In order to run the file, type the following in your terminal - 1 $ python3 variables.py Output will be as follows - 1 Baloons Congratulation! You just created a variable and printed its value.","title":"Declaring Variables"},{"location":"python/basics/variables/#understanding-variables","text":"Let us again have a look at the code we wrote above 1 2 box = Baloons print ( box ) You are declaring a variable called box and assigning it a value of Baloons , note the single quote around it, you can also use double quotes as follows and it will give you the same output. 1 2 box = Baloons print ( box ) Single and double quotes can be used interchangeably, but be sure to use a consistent style all across your code.","title":"Understanding Variables"},{"location":"python/basics/variables/#printing-values","text":"1 2 box = Baloons print ( box ) Line 2 prints the value of the variable 'box' to the terminal, which in our case is 'Baloons'. 1 Baloons print() is a builtin python function which we can easily use to print values.","title":"Printing Values"},{"location":"python/basics/variables/#re-assigning-values","text":"Suppose, now Billy wants to pack 'Party Hats' instead of 'Baloons', then we can re-assign a new value to the same variable 'box' 1 2 box = Party Hats print ( box ) You can again check the value by running the file 1 python3 variables.py Output 1 Party Hats Notice that our value has now changed from 'Baloons' to 'Party Hats'.
