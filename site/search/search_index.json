Why Erlang/Elixir And Phoenix? \u00b6 Every programming language is awesome only till the time it works for you and it's the worst when it doesn't, but its really up to you which demon you prefer, this is no ONE best language. There is this typical marketing pitch that Erlang/Elixir really offers excellent distributed concurrency, planet scalability, immutable values and fault tolerant systems, etc etc, but lets keep them aside for a while.

About Erlang/Elixir \u00b6 We need to give it, other languages did a fantastic job of presenting themself in a much better way, also the amount of marketing, conferences, sponsorships, etc have really shaped them to be much popular and widely used. Erlang/Elixir looks as if it has a cryptic syntax and functional programming makes them look difficult on the surface, but its really not the case, they are really great to work with and specially Elixir is designed to make developers feel happy . Feeling curious, what the hell is all this? Carry on... What is Erlang, Elixir And Phoenix \u00b6 Erlang/OTP is a concurrent functional programming language that forms the basic foundation, it was developed by Ericsson in 1986 and made open source in 1998. Erlang runs on its virtual machine called as the BEAM . OTP simply stands for Open Telecom Platform . Elixir builds on top of Erlang and provides a nice and easy way of interacting with the underlying system. It provides abstraction over Erlang, so that its easier for developers to code and finally it compiles to Erlang byte code. Phoenix Framework is a great set of tooling to create mature and blazing fast web applications, its based on Elixir and offers excellent framework to create highly scalable and concurrent distributed applications. We would be more focused on Elixir & Phoenix , but keep it mind that finally everything is compiled to Erlang byte code and runs on the BEAM. Elixir & Phoenix also has very good set of online documentation and the communities are also generally warm and helpful. Let the force be with you! Code Sample \u00b6 All code will be in the form of following block 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # Elixir code defmodule Hello do def say do :World end end Get Updates \u00b6 #mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; } /* Add your own Mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block.
